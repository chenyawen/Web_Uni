            <h3>Excavating at the Birthplace of Zeus*</h3>
               <h5 style="line-height:0px">David Gilman Romano & Mary E. Voyatzis</h5>
            <p>In the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet Callimachus wrote a Hymn to Zeus asking
                the ancient and most powerful Greek god whether he was born in Arcadia on Mt.
                Lykaion or in Crete on Mt. Ida.</p>
            <p>My soul is all in doubt, since debated is his birth. O Zeus, some say that you
                were born on the hills of Ida; others, O Zeus, say in Arcadia; did these or
                those, O Father lie? “Cretans are ever liars.”</p>
            <p>These two traditions relating to the birthplace of Zeus were clearly known in
                antiquity and have been transmitted to the modern day. It was one of the first
                matters that the village leaders in Ano Karyes brought to our attention when we
                arrived there in 2003 to initiate a new excavation and survey project at the nearby
                Sanctuary of Zeus. Situated high on the eastern slopes of Mt. Lykaion, Ano Karyes,
                with a winter population of 22, would become our base of operations, and the village
                leaders representing the Cultural Society of Ano Karyes would become our friends and
                collaborators in this endeavor. Could we prove that Zeus was born on Mt. Lykaion?</p>
            <p>Village leaders also retold the ancient reference by Pliny, a 1st century CE author,
                who wrote that the athletic festival at Mt. Lykaion, in honor of Zeus, was older than
                the games at Olympia. Could we find archaeological evidence to support this ancient
                reference? There was no doubt that the inhabitants of the local village were very proud
                of their heritage, and that we had our work cut out for us. Although our scientific objectives
                for the project were considerably different from the interests of the local people, little did
                we know that within only a few years we would have results that the village, as well as the
                archaeological community, would find relevant and intriguing. This visit was not my first to Ano
                Karyes or to the Sanctuary of Zeus. In 1996 I organized a computerized architectural and topographic
                survey project there with a small group of students from Penn, and succeeded in creating the first
                precise map of the important sanctuary. Earlier, in 1978, I carried out some of my Ph.D. dissertation
                work at Mt. Lykaion and was impressed with the beauty and majesty of the site. From that moment, it
                was my sincere hope to return one day to do fieldwork and excavation.</p>
